# Finding cabs nearby using Great Circle Distance formula
Given GPS co-ordinates(in degrees) of a person who needs a cab and co-ordinates of all the cabs in the city stored in a text file in JSON format, find the user-id and name of all the cab drivers available in 50 km proximity.

Input : file customers.json which contains GPS co-ordinates of a person who needs a cab in degrees and co-ordinates of all the cabs in the city stored in a text file in JSON format.

Output : file answers.json which contains user-id and Name of all the cab drivers available in 50 km proximity stored in a new file.

Approach Used:
1. Obtain latitude and longitude of each cab in string format along with their
user-id and name from the JSON encoded input file.

2. Convert latitude and longitude of the cab present in string format to double.

3. Convert latitude and longitude of both, the user and the cab present in
degrees to radians.

4. Calculate distance between the userâ€™s location and the cab using Great Circle
Distance formula.

5. If distance is found to be less than or equal to 50 kms then output the user-
id and name of the cab driver to a new file else take no action.
